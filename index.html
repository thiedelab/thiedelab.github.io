                        We are a computational chemistry group at Cornell University.
                        Our focus is computational analytical chemistry:
                        designing and understanding how algorithms give quantitative predictions in chemistry.
                        Currently, our research centers on three areas:
                        <!-- Proteins are fundamental to the molecular machinery of life: they are nature's freight trains, -->
                        <!-- construction cranes, and chemical factories. -->
                        <!-- But the basic principles of this machinery are poorly understood. -->
                        <!-- By developing new algorithms that combine -->

                            Proteins are fundamental to the molecular machinery of life.
                            Many proteins are highly conformationally heterogeneous, switching between structures to achieve their goals.
                            We attempt to build algorithms that can recover these changes in structure from cryogenic electron microscopy experiments.

                            <span class="value-highlight">Heterogeneity in In-Situ EM</span>
                            Recently, in-situ electron microscope techniques have enabled materials to be imaged while they are undergoing meaningful chemical reaction.
                            Moreover, combining in-situ experiments with advanced electron microscopy techniques such as 4D-STEM or EELS provide rich data about how material composition changes over time.
                            However, the resulting data is often very noisy.  We develop new algorithms for analyzing in-situ EM experiments that can function with noisy data, giving reliable insights in the face of statistical uncertainty.

                            <span class="value-highlight">Manipulating Protein Language Models</span>
                            Protein language models apply the same technology that powers natural language models such as ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek to the sequence of amino acids that make up a protein.  We are exploring the capabilities of these models for zero-shot and few-shot prediction of protein properties.  In addition, we are attempting to close the loop between protein language model and experimental peptide design, allowing for rapid and efficient iterations on peptide drug candidates.
